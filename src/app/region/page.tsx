              The Kalabari are a sub-group of the Ijaw people living in the
              eastern Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Originally, they were known
              as the Awome. The name Kalabari was derived from their ancestor
              Perebokelekeibari who was a son of Mein Owei.

              Their original settlement was Old shipping also known as Elem-Ama
              (Old Kalabari). This settlement (town) was abandoned as the people
              moved to other fishing settlements. Portuguese settlers continued
              to maintain the name New Calabar which came about when they met
              the Duke of Calabar on a sailing expedition he was found along the
              River called Kalabari toru so they named it New Calabar river.

              When the British came the word Kalabari was pronounced as Calabar
              (Kalaba) instead of Kalabari. At this time the original Ijaw
              Kalabaris had moved to a new location which became the new Calabar
              territory since the old Calabar is occupied by different people.
              Old Calabar became an Efik town with time which has the name
              Calabar.
